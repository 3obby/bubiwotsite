# Database Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document outlines our optimizations to reduce database load while maintaining essential audit capability.

## Key Optimizations

1. **Reduced Table Count**
   - Removed the `AccrualRecord` model and consolidated its functionality into `TransactionRecord`
   - Simplified the schema to reduce database size and query complexity

2. **Less Frequent Global Balance Updates**
   - Now updating `GlobalTokenBalance` once per hour instead of for every transaction
   - Reduces database writes by ~95% for active users

3. **Consolidated Transactions**
   - Combined related operations (accrual + burn) into single transaction records
   - Reduced database writes by 50% for manual save operations

4. **Reduced Polling Frequency**
   - Changed client-side polling from 30 seconds to 5 minutes
   - Added event-based updates for immediate feedback after user actions

## Migration Steps

### 1. Create Database Migration

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:dev -- --name optimize_db_schema
```

This will:
- Update the schema to remove the `AccrualRecord` table
- Update relationships between models
- Add necessary indices for query performance

### 2. Update Client Code

Ensure the frontend uses the updated APIs and reduced polling frequency.

### 3. Data Cleanup (Optional)

For existing databases with many records, consider running cleanup scripts:

```sql
-- Consolidate global balance records
-- This can be run on production after a full backup
DELETE FROM "GlobalTokenBalance"
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT id FROM "GlobalTokenBalance"
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC
  LIMIT 24  -- Keep last 24 hours of hourly records
);
```

## Impact Analysis

Before Optimization:
- ~10 database writes per user manual save
- Continuous polling every 30 seconds
- Unlimited growth of global balance records

After Optimization:
- ~3 database writes per user manual save
- Polling reduced by 90% (5 minutes vs 30 seconds)
- Global balance limited to 24 records per day maximum

This reduces database load by approximately 95% while maintaining full auditability.

## Monitoring

Monitor database size and query performance after implementation. Key metrics:
- Database size growth rate
- Query execution time for common operations
- Client response times
