# Introduction to BUBIWOT Protocol

**Layer-Zero for the Trust-Minimized Web of Trust**

Towards:
- Trust-minimized proof-of-personhood.
- Next-gen authentication.
- Next-gen account management.
- Universal basic income.
- Social cryptographic primitives.

### What is BUBIWOT?

BUBIWOT (Bitcoin-backed Universal Basic Income Web of Trust) is the **foundational layer-zero protocol** for a new cryptographic primitive: the **trust-minimized web of trust**. 

While initially designed for Bitcoin-backed Universal Basic Income distribution, BUBIWOT establishes the fundamental infrastructure for any application requiring trust-minimized human verification, social recovery, and decentralized identity management.

The protocol creates a revolutionary system where **every real-world interaction serves dual cryptographic purposes**: proving humanity for economic participation AND building threshold signature recovery networks.

### The Trust-Minimized Web of Trust Primitive

BUBIWOT introduces a new cryptographic primitive that enables:

**ü§ù Dual-Purpose IRL Attestations**
- **Humanity Verification**: Cryptographic proof of human uniqueness without revealing identity
- **Key Fragment Exchange**: Threshold signature share distribution for social recovery
- **Progressive Trust Building**: Each interaction strengthens both verification and recovery networks

**üîê Threshold Social Recovery**
- **Incremental Decentralization**: Start with single device, progressively add guardians
- **Flexible Security Models**: 2-of-3 ‚Üí 3-of-5 ‚Üí 4-of-7 thresholds adapt to social network growth
- **Bitcoin-Native Recovery**: FROST signatures work directly with Bitcoin/Lightning

**üåê Network-Effect Trust**
- **Cryptographic Social Graphs**: Anonymous attestations create verifiable trust networks
- **Sybil Resistance**: Physical attestations prevent fake account proliferation
- **Reputation Layers**: Trust scores emerge from attestation quality and frequency

### Core Principles

- **Trust Minimization**: No central authority controls verification, distribution, or recovery processes
- **IRL-First Architecture**: Physical meetings create the strongest cryptographic trust bonds
- **Progressive Decentralization**: Security and trust models upgrade incrementally with social network growth
- **Bitcoin-Native Implementation**: Direct integration with Bitcoin, Lightning, and threshold cryptography
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Anonymous attestations protect identity while ensuring authenticity
- **Dual-Purpose Efficiency**: Every interaction serves multiple cryptographic functions simultaneously

### How the Primitive Works

The trust-minimized web of trust operates on **four fundamental layers**:

#### 1. Cryptographic Identity Layer
- **Client-Side Key Generation**: Ed25519 keypairs generated locally
- **Biometric Protection**: WebAuthn/passkeys secure private keys on-device
- **Threshold Migration**: Single keys evolve into socially-recoverable threshold signatures
- **No Personal Data**: Only cryptographic identities, never personal information

#### 2. Physical Attestation Layer
- **IRL Pairing**: QR/NFC-based secure local connections
- **Mutual Verification**: Peers simultaneously verify each other's humanity
- **Key Fragment Exchange**: FROST threshold shares distributed during attestations
- **Cryptographic Bonding**: Physical meetings create strongest trust relationships

#### 3. Social Recovery Layer
- **Guardian Networks**: Threshold signature schemes enable collaborative key recovery
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Security models adapt as social networks grow
- **Key Rotation**: Seamless guardian addition without account recreation
- **Emergency Recovery**: Rapid response to device loss or compromise

#### 4. Economic Incentive Layer
- **UBI Distribution**: Bitcoin-backed tokens reward network participation
- **Anti-Sybil Economics**: Real economic value prevents fake account creation
- **Progressive Activation**: Bitcoin deposits unlock full economic functionality
- **Network Effects**: Growing participation increases individual and collective value

### Key Innovations

**The Dual-Purpose Attestation**: Unlike any existing system, BUBIWOT attestations simultaneously serve proof-of-humanity AND threshold key recovery‚Äîmaximizing the value of every real-world interaction.

**Progressive Threshold Security**: Start with simple single-device security, then incrementally upgrade to sophisticated multi-party threshold schemes as your social network grows.

**Bitcoin-Native Social Recovery**: FROST threshold signatures work directly with Bitcoin and Lightning, eliminating the need for complex smart contract systems while maintaining full programmability.

**IRL-First Trust Bonds**: Physical meetings create cryptographically verifiable trust relationships that are orders of magnitude stronger than online-only verification methods.

### Applications Beyond UBI

The trust-minimized web of trust primitive enables multiple applications:

**üèõÔ∏è Decentralized Governance**
- Sybil-resistant voting systems
- Progressive delegation based on trust networks
- Anonymous but verifiable participation

**üîê Social Recovery Wallets**
- Threshold signature wallets for any cryptocurrency
- Cross-chain social recovery systems
- Enterprise multi-signature management

**üåê Web of Trust Authentication**
- Password-less authentication systems  
- Decentralized identity verification
- Anonymous but trusted access control

**ü§ù Peer-to-Peer Networks**
- Trust-scored marketplace systems
- Decentralized lending/borrowing protocols
- Anonymous reputation systems

### Problem Statement

Current trust and identity systems face fundamental limitations:

1. **Centralized Trust**: Existing systems require trusted authorities for verification and recovery
2. **Sybil Vulnerability**: Difficult to prevent fake accounts without invasive identity checks
3. **Recovery Complexity**: Seed phrases and hardware tokens create poor user experience
4. **Privacy Violations**: Traditional verification exposes sensitive personal information
5. **Single-Purpose Systems**: Each application requires separate identity and trust infrastructure
6. **Economic Misalignment**: No incentive mechanisms to encourage honest participation

BUBIWOT's trust-minimized web of trust addresses each challenge through cryptographic design and economic incentives.

### Vision: Layer-Zero for Human Coordination

The ultimate vision of BUBIWOT extends far beyond Universal Basic Income:

**üåç Global Infrastructure**
- Foundational layer for any application requiring human verification
- Interoperable across all blockchain networks and traditional systems
- Censorship-resistant operation independent of any government or corporation

**üî¨ Cryptographic Innovation**
- New primitive enabling previously impossible applications
- Foundation for post-password authentication systems
- Social cryptography as robust as individual cryptography

**ü§ù Human-Centric Design**
- Technology that enhances rather than replaces human relationships
- Privacy-preserving systems that respect human dignity
- Progressive decentralization matching natural social network growth

**üí∞ Economic Sustainability**
- Self-reinforcing economic incentives prevent system degradation
- Bitcoin-backed value ensures long-term sustainability
- Network effects create positive feedback loops

### Getting Started: UBI as the First Application

While the trust-minimized web of trust enables countless applications, BUBIWOT begins with Universal Basic Income because:

- **Clear Value Proposition**: Everyone understands the benefit of basic income
- **Strong Anti-Sybil Incentives**: Real economic value prevents fake accounts
- **Natural Network Growth**: People are motivated to onboard friends and family
- **Global Relevance**: UBI appeals across all demographics and geographies

The current MVP focuses on:

- **Client-side identity generation and threshold key management**
- **IRL attestation mechanisms with dual-purpose functionality**
- **UBI allocation tracking with Bitcoin-backed value**
- **Progressive social recovery system development**
- **Foundation for the broader trust-minimized web of trust ecosystem**

### Conclusion: A New Primitive for Human Coordination

BUBIWOT represents more than a UBI system‚Äîit's the **layer-zero infrastructure** for a new era of human coordination technology. By solving the fundamental challenge of trust-minimized proof-of-personhood while simultaneously enabling robust social recovery systems, BUBIWOT creates the foundation for countless applications we haven't yet imagined.

The trust-minimized web of trust primitive promises to be as foundational to human coordination as public-key cryptography was to digital security‚Äîenabling new forms of cooperation, governance, and economic activity that respect both individual sovereignty and collective flourishing.

**The future of human coordination is cryptographic, social, and trust-minimized. BUBIWOT makes it possible.**
