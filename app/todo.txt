=== AGENT PROMPTS FOR REDDIT-STYLE MESSAGE BOARD ===

PROMPT 1: Database Schema Updates
"Add the following fields to the Prisma schema for the message board functionality:

Post model additions:
- stake: Decimal @default(0) @db.Decimal(12,8) // Staked amount for decay math
- expiresAt: DateTime? // When post expires based on decay
- effectiveValue: Decimal @default(0) @db.Decimal(12,8) // Computed field for sorting

Reply model additions:
- stake: Decimal @default(0) @db.Decimal(12,8)
- expiresAt: DateTime?
- effectiveValue: Decimal @default(0) @db.Decimal(12,8)

Create new EmojiReaction model:
- id, userId, postId?, replyId?, emoji, amount, createdAt
- Proper relations and indexes

Update User model to include:
- emojiReactions: EmojiReaction[]

Run migration and update Prisma client."

PROMPT 2: Core Message Board Component
"Create a MessageBoard component that renders as a card on the front page below the user stats. Structure:

- Tabbed interface with 3 tabs: 'Global', 'Transactions', 'Users'
- Default to 'Global' tab open
- Card styling consistent with existing user stats card
- Responsive mobile-first design
- State management for active tab
- Place this component in the main page.tsx after the user stats panel"

PROMPT 3: Global Feed Tab Implementation
"Build the Global feed tab with reddit-style threading:

Features needed:
- Tree-structured message display (posts -> replies -> nested replies)
- Craigslist-minimalism styling (clean, simple, text-focused)
- Click to expand/collapse threads
- Show: author alias, timestamp, content, stake amount, total donations
- Sort by effectiveValue (stake + donations with time decay)
- Pagination or infinite scroll
- 'Reply' button on each post/reply

API endpoints:
- GET /api/posts/feed - fetch posts with replies
- POST /api/posts/create - create new post
- POST /api/replies/create - create reply to post or reply

Use recursive components for nested threading."

PROMPT 4: Transaction History Tab
"Create the Transactions tab showing user's transaction history:

Display all TransactionRecord entries for current user:
- Transaction type (post, reply, donate, emoji, collect, etc.)
- Amount (+/-) with color coding
- Balance before/after
- Timestamp
- Clickable rows to see detailed metadata
- Filter by transaction type
- Export functionality (CSV)

Table format with:
- Date/Time | Type | Amount | Balance | Details button
- Modal popup for transaction details showing full metadata JSON
- Pagination with 50 records per page"

PROMPT 5: Users Directory Tab  
"Build the Users tab with directory and profile views:

Main view - User directory:
- List all users with basic stats
- Alias, join date, total credits, post count
- Search/filter functionality
- Click user to view profile

Profile modal:
- User stats (lifetime allocated, collected, burned)
- Recent posts/replies
- Transaction history
- Donation given/received summary
- Visual charts if possible

API endpoints:
- GET /api/users/directory - list all users
- GET /api/users/[id]/profile - detailed user profile
- Include privacy controls for future"

PROMPT 6: Post Creation Interface
"Add post creation functionality to the Global tab:

- 'Create Post' button at top of feed
- Modal with:
  - Content textarea (1000 char limit)
  - Stake amount input (minimum required)
  - Preview functionality
  - Cost breakdown (stake + 3% protocol fee)
  - Submit button

Validation:
- Check user has sufficient credits
- Content length validation
- Minimum stake requirements

After creation:
- Refresh feed
- Show success message
- Scroll to new post"

PROMPT 7: Reply System Implementation
"Build the reply functionality:

Reply button on each post/reply opens modal:
- Quote/reference parent content
- Reply textarea (1000 chars)
- Stake amount (can be 0 for replies)
- Threading level indicator
- Submit creates nested reply

Visual threading:
- Indent levels for nested replies
- Connecting lines for visual hierarchy
- Collapse/expand functionality
- 'Show more replies' for deep threads
- Color coding by thread depth"

PROMPT 8: Emoji Reaction System
"Implement micro-tipping via emoji reactions:

Features:
- Emoji picker on hover/click each post/reply
- First emoji costs more, subsequent cheaper
- Show emoji counts with hover tooltips showing amounts
- Animated emoji when tipped
- Tip splitting: 3% to system, remaining 85% author,  15% divided evenly among ancestors (if any)

UI:
- Emoji bar below each post showing reactions with counts
- Click emoji to add reaction (opens amount modal)
- Show your own reactions highlighted
- Real-time updates when others react"

PROMPT 9: API Routes and Database Operations
"Create all necessary API routes:

/api/posts/feed:
- Fetch posts with nested replies
- Apply time decay calculations
- Sort by effectiveValue
- Include user data and reaction counts

/api/posts/create:
- Validate stake amount and user balance
- Deduct stake + protocol fee
- Create post with expiresAt
- Update user transaction record

/api/replies/create:
- Create nested reply with proper parentId
- Handle threading up to 10 levels deep
- Update ancestor effective values

/api/emoji/react:
- Process emoji tip transaction
- Split payment to author and ancestors
- Update reaction counts

/api/posts/[id]/details:
- Get detailed post data with full thread
- Include all reactions and donations"

PROMPT 10: Real-time Features and Polish
"Add real-time updates and polish:

Real-time features:
- polling for live updates (every 10s)
- New posts appear without refresh
- Reaction counts update live
- Show 'X new posts' notification

Polish items:
- Loading states (showing data) for all operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Smooth animations for expand/collapse
- Mobile-responsive design

PROMPT 11: Time Decay and Expiration Logic
"let's implement a time decay system- in this reddit-like message board, posts are indexed by value. that value should entitle a post to exist, and should decay over time, enabling the author to reclaim any released portion of their stake (if any) at any time. in addition, posts may recieve tips/bonuses that serve to both extend the post lifespan (up to a max of 90 days) and donate value to the author. 

Decay function:
- effectiveValue = baseStake * e^(-λt) + totalDonations * e^(-λt_donation) (your opinionated implementation is fine)
- Real-time decay calculation in feed sorting

Expiration handling:
- Visual countdown timers on posts (simple-style, like '~90d...', '~3h...')
- 'Reclaim' button on posts the user has authored
- Archive expired posts or mark inactive
- Reclaim process returns remaining stake + bonuses

regular calculation of all effective values should not be necessary- the re-ranking should trigger when new posts are triggered, causing a recursive chain of updates down the branch. please ensure the 'create post', 'donate', and 'emoji' workflows each trigger a server-side call to re-calculate the time decay of posts at that level/depth. this should:
- Update database with current values
- Clean up truly expired content"

PROMPT 12: Integration with Existing UI
"Integrate the message board seamlessly:

Placement:
- Add MessageBoard component after user stats panel in main page
- Same card styling and responsive behavior
- Smooth tab transitions
- Consistent color scheme and typography

State management:
- Share user context with existing components
- Update credits display when posting/tipping
- Integrate with TokenCollectButton refresh cycle
- Handle login state changes

Performance:
- Lazy load tabs (don't fetch data until tab opened)
- Virtual scrolling for large feeds
- Debounced search and filtering
- Cache frequently accessed data"
