### Key Features
- **Thread depth tracking** for proper nesting visualization
- **Stake amount integration** with cost calculation
- **Credit balance validation** before submission
- **Automatic feed refresh** after successful reply creation
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to the application** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Create or find a post** to reply to
3. **Click the "reply" button** to open the modal

   - Feed refreshes to show new reply
   - Threading visuals work correctly
   - Nested replies display properly

## Visual Threading Test Cases

1. **Single level replies** - Should show L1 indicator and blue theme

3. **Deep threads** (6+ levels) - Should show warning at max depth
4. **Many replies** - Should show "Show more" functionality

## Expected Behavior

- **Modal opens** when clicking reply button
- **Parent content quoted** with author attribution
- **Real-time cost calculation** as user types
- **Stake amount optional** and defaults to 0
- **Thread depth properly tracked** and displayed
- **Visual hierarchy clear** with colors and indentation
- **Performance optimized** with proper state management
